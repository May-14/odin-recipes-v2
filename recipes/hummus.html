        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can of raw chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda - only if using canned chickpeas</li>
            <li>1/4 cups of lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 medium clove garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tahini</li>
            <li>2 to 4 tsp of ice water</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp of ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp of evoo</li>
            <li>any of the following: drizzle of olive oil or zhoug sauce, sprinkle of ground 
                sumac or paprika, chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>place the chickpeas in a medium saucepan and add the baking soda. 
                cover the chickpeas by several inches of water, then bring the mixture to a 
                boil over high heat. continue boiling, reducing heat if necessary to prevent 
                overflow, for about 20 minutes, or until the chickpeas look bloated, their 
                skins are falling off, and they're quite soft. in a fine-mesh strainer, drain 
                the chickpeas and run cool water over them for about 30 seconds. set aside (no need to 
                peel the chickpeas for this recipe!).
            </li>
            <li>meanwhile, in a food processor or high-powered blender, combine the lemon juice, garlic, 
                and salt. process until the garlic is very finely chopped, then let the mixture rest so the 
                garlic flavor can mellow, ideally 10 minutes or longer.
            </li>
            <li>add the tahini to the food processor and blend until the mixture is thick and creamy, 
                stopping to scrape down any tahini stuck to the sides and bottom of the processor as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>while running the food processor, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of ice water. 
                scrape down the food processor, and blend until the mixture is ultra smooth, pale, and creamy. 
                (if your tahini was extra-thick to begin with, you might need to add 1 to 2 tablespoons more ice water.)
            </li>
            <li>add the cumin and the drained, over-cooked chickpeas to the food processor. 
                while blending, drizzle in the olive oil. blend until the 
                mixture is super smooth, scraping down the sides of the processor as necessary, about 2 minutes. 
                add more ice water by the tablespoon if necessary to achieve a super creamy texture.
            </li>
            <li>taste, and adjust as necessary—i almost always add another ¼ teaspoon salt for more overall flavor and 
                another tablespoon of lemon juice for extra zing.
            </li>
            <li>scrape the hummus into a serving bowl or platter, and use a spoon to create nice swooshes on top. 
                top with garnishes of your choice, and serve. 
                leftover hummus keeps well in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 1 week.
            </li>
            <li><strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
