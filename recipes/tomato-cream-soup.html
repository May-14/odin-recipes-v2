        <h2>recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>heat a nonreactive pot or enameled dutch oven over medium heat. 
                add butter then add chopped onions. sauté 10-12 minutes, stirring 
                occasionally, until softened and golden. add minced garlic and sauté 1 minute 
                until fragrant.</li>
            <li>add crushed tomatoes with their juice, chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar 
                (or add sugar to taste), and black pepper. stir together and bring to a boil 
                then reduce heat, partially cover with lid and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>you can leave your soup with a chunky consistency, but if you like a blended/creamy 
                soup, use an immersion blender to blend the soup in the pot to desired consistency 
                or transfer to a blender in batches and blend until smooth (being careful not to 
                over-fill the blender with hot liquid and pulse a few times initially to get 
                it started), then return blended soup to the pot over medium heat.</li>
            <li>put the mix in a pan and put it in the oven</li>
            <li>add 1/2 cup heavy cream, 1/3 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese and return to a 
                simmer. Season to taste with salt and pepper if needed and turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>after 12 1/2 minutes remove the pan from the oven</li>
            <li>Ladle into warm bowls and top with more parmesan and chopped fresh basil.</li>
            <li><strong>enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>
